#### Summary
I am a Technology Optimist, graduated **Computer and Automation Engineering** at **Marche Polytechnic University (Marche, Italy)**, semester abroad at **Augsburg University of Applied Sciences (Bayern, Germany)**, intern at **The Qt Company (Oslo, Norway)** during the **Google Summer of Code** program. I'm currently enrolled in the **Artificial Intelligence** MSc at the **University of Bologna**, studying things like Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and the mathematics behind these.

My hobbies include playing chess, solving problems and anything I can test my logic against.

#### Technologies I like
* C/C++
* Docker
* Git
* LaTeX
* Linux

#### Even though I like development, it ain't my cup of tea. I am totally fascinated by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 
In the last years I had the pleasure of working with:
* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* SciKit Learn
* TensorFlow
* OpenCV
* PyTorch

#### Technologies I don't really like
These don't actually exist. I'm very curious about things I don't usually work with. Hit me up with that knowledge!
